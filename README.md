# OpenShift Quickstarts
Centralized repository of community quickstarts that anyone can import into their OpenShift deployments.


### Objective:
With the addition of [Quick starts to OpenShift](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/web_console/creating-quick-start-tutorials.html) we want to curate a place for people to create and contribute quick starts to use for their deployments that may not be included in an operator.

### OCP Quick Start Ideas

Please add to the list here of quickstarts that would be helpful.

| Quickstart | Details |
| ---------- | ------- |

| OCP-Virt port mapping | How to open SSH or RDP to a vm)|

Please Place a pull request to the repository or put in an issue and we will add to the list.
